Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n","\n","The main data structures in Pandas are implemented with Series and DataFrame classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of Seriesinstances. DataFrames are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (objects, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features for each of the instances.\n","\n","> Pandas is like Excel in Python: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.\n","\n","**Installing Pandas**\n","\n","`python -m pip install pandas`\n","\n","or\n","\n","`conda install pandas`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ggAwqSb7tn5G"},"source":["## Using the Pandas Python Library\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fjtT46ybtn5H"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6nGVYOF6tn5i"},"source":["## Getting to Know Pandas’ Data Structures\n","\n","### Understanding Series Objects\n","\n","Python’s most basic data structure is the list, which is also a good starting point for getting to know pandas.Series objects.
